## Usage
To use devtkit, simply follow along with the prompts the script gives you.

> To get a DEV.to API Key, navigate to: DEV.to -> Settings -> Extensions, and scroll till you find "DEV Community API Keys"
> The API Key you generate will still be available for you to see after you close the tab, so you do not need to save it (unlike most API Keys)

An example run is:

```text
--- Formats ---

0. Markdown
1. CSV
2. JSON 

Please enter the numbers for the following formats you would like to save to: 012
